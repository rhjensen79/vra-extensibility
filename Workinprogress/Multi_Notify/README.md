# Multi Notify

A development, from the Slack notification action.
The idea here, is to have one action, that support notifications in as many different platforms, as possible.

Currently it's planned for the following platforms.

- Slack
- Email
- Telegram
- Ms Teams

Let me know if more are needed, and if you are able to help. 

## Pre-requisites

### Telegram
- Create bot (type /newbot @BotFather) and save token.
- Create group
- Add bot to group as admin.
- Get group id (https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBOTToken>/getUpdates) and save it.
